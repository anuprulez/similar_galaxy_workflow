# Galaxy workflows as graphs
The workflows of Galaxy are directed graphs in which each node is represented by a Galaxy tool. It is a data processing pipeline through which datasets undergo some transformation at each node. These transformations include text manipulation, sorting on a column, deletion or addition of a column and so on.
