# Predict next tool in Galaxy workflows

## Galaxy workflows as directed graphs
[Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/) workflow is a chain of (Galaxy) tools to process biological data. These datasets undergo a transformation at each node (a tool) which includes text manipulation, sorting on a column, deletion or addition of a column and so on. Each workflow can be considered as a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) where the output of each node becomes an input to the next node(s). Visit this [website](https://rawgit.com/anuprulez/similar_galaxy_workflow/master/viz/index.html) to see all the steps of a workflow and its directed graph. Choose a workflow from the dropdown and see the [Cytoscape](http://js.cytoscape.org/) graph. A typical [workflow](https://usegalaxy.org/workflow/editor?id=4ef668a0f832a731) in Galaxy looks like this:

## Predict next tool
If a Galaxy user can see a list of possible next tool(s) at all stages of creating a workflow, it would be convenient and time-saving to create one. This work aims to achieve it by training a neural network on the existing set of workflows created by multiple users. There is a special kind of (recurrent) neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), which learns connections in the input (sequential) data and predicts the next possible connections(s). The Galaxy workflows also qualify as sequential data (as a chain of tools) and this network is expected to work on these data processing pipelines to predict next possible connections. Moreover, this work identifies itself as a part of recommendation system for Galaxy tools and workflows. The approach is explained below:

Suppose we have a workflow:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anuprulez/similar_galaxy_workflow/master/images/workflow1.png">
</p>

This workflow can be broken down into following smaller sequences (or training samples):

- pileometh > Remove beginning 1 (label)
- pileometh > Remove beginning 1 > Add_a_column1 (label)
- Add_a_column1 > cut1 > addValue (label)
- so on ...

The last item in each such path is a label (or category) of the previous sequence (of tools) which means that this label should be in the predicted set of next tools for that sequence. For example, "pileometh > Remove beginning 1" is a training sample and its label is "Add_a_column1". Following this way, each path is divided into training samples (a tool or a sequence of tools) and their labels. The logic behind this breking up of a workflow is to make the classifier learn that if we are at a stage "pileometh > Remove beginning 1" of creating a workflow, the next tool would be "Add_a_column1". A similar approach is used for predicting next word in sentences. Here, we can draw an analogy between our smaller sequences from workflows and smaller parts of sentences (in English for example). They are similar - sentences in a language like in English (`I → want → to → go → to → Berlin`) and our smaller sequences (`filter1 → grouping1 → addvalue → join1`) as both make sense only when their components are arranged in a particular order.

To feed these input training samples (smaller parts of workflows) into the neural network, we need to convert them into vectors (neural networks understand vectors and not words or text). In order to convert them into vectors, we create a list of unique nodes (tools) and assign them unique integers (let's call them an id for each node). Now, we take a training sample and identify its nodes, take their respective ids and arrange these integers in the same order as the original tool sequence. For example, let's take this small dummy workflow:

`filter1 → grouping1 → addvalue → join1 → add_a_column1`

Let's create a dictionary mapping a unique integer to each tool:

- `{ "addvalue": 1, "add_a_column1": 2, "filter1": 3, "join1": 4, "grouping1": 5 }`

Now, create a training sample - a vector for the workflow:
- `filter1 → grouping1 → addvalue → join1` (training sample)
- `add_a_column1` (a label for the above part of workflow)
- `[ 0, 0,......, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4 ]` (`0`s are added to make up for the maximum length of the input data).

Now, it's time for creating the label vector. It is multi-hot encoded vector which means that this vector is all zeros except for the position(s) of the next tools. For example:

- `[ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ]` (a label vector for tool "add_a_column1" because its position value is `2` in the dictionary. So, the `3`rd index of the vector is `1` and others are zeros).

If there are multiple labels for a training sample (which happens to be the case in this work), we add `1s` to all the positions of the corresponding labels).
- `[ 0, 1, 1, 0, 1 ]` shows a multi-hot encoded label vector.

We create training samples and their labels in this manner and feed them to the network. The first layer in the network is an embedding layer which learns a dense, low dimensional vector for each training sample which are largely sparse. These dense, low dimensional vectors are then fed into the LSTM layer. Dropout is added between layers in order to avoid overfitting which happens when the learning (prediction performance) becomes better on training data and stops/saturates on test (unseen) data.

## Accuracy measure
In our set of training samples, each one can have many labels (or categories) which means that there can be multiple (next) tools for a sequence of tools. However if we measure accuracy of our approach which predicts just one next tool, it would be partially correct. Hence, we assess the performance on top 5 predicted tools (top-5 accuracy). In this accuracy measure, we verify if the actual label(s) is/are present in the top 5 predicted labels for a training sequence.

## Accuracy on test data

`20%` of all samples are taken out for testing the trained model's performance and the rest is used to train the model. The plot below shows an accuracy of k actual labels being present in the top-k predicted labels for a sequence over 90 training epochs (iterations). We can see the performance saturates around `60th` epoch. Here, "k" can be any number i.e. a sequence can have any number of labels. Suppose a sequence has 5 labels (5 tools it can connect to). We predict top 5 tools and find how many of these actual tools are present in the predicted tools. An accuracy of `80%` would mean that `4` out of `5` actual next tools are present in the predicted tools. An averate accuracy is computed over all test samples.

</p>

The plot below shows a different way to assess the accuracy of the estimator/classifier. It computes an average of the number of times actual labels appear in the top-5 predicted labels for all samples in the test data. For example, let's suppose a sequence has 4 actual labels (4 next tools it can connect to).
We check that out of these 4 actual labels, how many are present in the top-5 predicted ones. If 3 labels are present in the top-5 predicted, we assign an accuracy of `3/4 = 0.75` for this sequence. In the same way, we compute this accuracy for all the samples in the test data and compute the mean. The plot shows an increase of this `mean accuracy` over `90` epochs of training.

## Vizualizer

The screenshots below show possible next tools for a sequence at each stage of creating a dummy workflow - `wc_gnu → collapse_dataset → join1 → join1 → cut1 → join1 → filter1 → cut1 → filter1 → grouping1 → addvalue → join1 → add_a_column1 → filter1`

All the paths containing this sequence of tools are also shown.
